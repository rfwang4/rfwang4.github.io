## Urban Design Work

### Site Analysis of Metrotown, Burnaby

In this collaborative project, we were tasked with analyzing the built environment of Metrotown, a Metro Vancouver regional town centre located in Burnaby. I created the following cross-sections of prototypical urban morphologies in the neighbourhood as part of the project in Adobe Illustrator.

### Redesign of Scott Road Corridor in Surrey, BC

In this collaborative project, we were tasked with re-envisioning the Scott Road/120th Street corridor in Surrey, BC through the lens of landscape ecology, as described by Dramstad et al. in the book *[Landscape Ecology Principles in Landscape Architecture and Land-Use Planning](https://islandpress.org/books/landscape-ecology-principles-landscape-architecture-and-land-use-planning)*. As part of my work on this project, I created the following illustrations of our hypothetical design intervention at the Scott Road/99th Avenue intersection, comprising a multi-use rail trail and elevated wildlife crossing.
