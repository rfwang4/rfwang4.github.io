title: "Ruofan Wang - Aspiring Urban Planner"

## Introduction

I am an aspiring urban planner with varied interests in understanding efficient political governance, identifying spatial inequalities in the urban sphere, and building resilient cities during our ongoing climate emergency. I am currently based out of Vancouver, but I am from Montreal and have spent some time in Beijing and Qingdao, China.
