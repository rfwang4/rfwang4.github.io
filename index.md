## Introduction

I am an aspiring urban planner with varied interests in understanding efficient political governance, identifying spatial inequalities in the urban sphere, and building resilient cities during our ongoing climate emergency. I am currently based out of Vancouver but grew up in Beijing and Montreal.

## Background

I am currently a candidate in the Master of Community and Regional Planning (MCRP) at the University of British Columbia, with a specialization in social planning and urban design.

I have a B.A. (Hons.) from McGill University in Urban Studies and Sociology. My thesis interrogated the connection between land-use decisions and decision-makers' interests in the conservation context through a political geography lens.
