## Research and Analysis

### Honours Thesis: *Places to Stand, Places to Grow*

My honours thesis used a political geography lens to study the relation between the demographic characteristics of decision-makers and the land-use decisions they made. My exploratory research focused on conservation authorities in Ontario, a poorly understood form of special district organized at the watershed level, and used regression analysis and raster GIS techniques to calculate the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) change and the personal characteristics of authority board members. I received First-Class Honours at the completion of my honours degree.

### Policy Brief: Transportation for the East End of Montreal

In this policy brief that I prepared as part of my coursework for a graduate-level environmental planning course at McGill University, I analyze the future transportation options available in the East End, a low-income, auto-dependent region of the Island of Montreal that has been historically underserved by alternative transportation options. I received an A in this course.

In this term paper submitted for an upper-level seminar on urban ethnography, I read two ethnographies—[*Driving After Class*](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520277755/driving-after-class) by Rachel Heiman and [*The Changs Next Door to the Diazes*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-changs-next-door-to-the-daazes) by Wendy Cheng—to discuss these two different perspectives on the construction of racial identities and exclusions in the North American suburb. I received an A in this course.
