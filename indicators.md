## Plan Implementation

I am currently working with the [UBC Sustainability Initiative](https://sustain.ubc.ca/) as a Climate Emergency Academic Assistant to support the implementation of the [*Final Report and Recommendations of the Climate Emergency Task Force*](https://climateemergency.ubc.ca/). As part of my work, I have researched best practices for environmental plan monitoring at other North American public institutions and assisted in the development of a tailored indicator framework suitable for the needs of UBC.
